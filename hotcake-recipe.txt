Ingredients:
 - 20g miller sugar
 - 100g all-purpose flour
 - 1 egg
 - 100cc milk
 - some sesame

Directions:
 1. Put 20g of cracked sugar and mix with a whisk.
 
 2. Put 100 g of flour and mix with a whisk(not 
    swinging as it is troublesome).
 
 3. Recently my boom is to rub the sesame roughly.

 4. Pour a proper amount into the heated pan.

 5. 2 minutes on one side, 2 minutes on inverting. 
    It can not be puffed like an ordinary hot cake. 
    When the surroundings dry about 1/2, it is a standard.

 6. Dough is easier to flow than commercially available, 
    so it is easier to make a smaller shape. Children will 
    be delighted when arranging circles and making it like Anpanman.
